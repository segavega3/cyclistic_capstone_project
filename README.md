Business Recommendations

  Why? Casual riders take longer, more leisure-focused rides but are less consistent.
Strategy: Offer discounts on electric bike memberships, which casual riders prefer.


2Ô∏è. Optimize Marketing Campaigns Based on Peak Usage
  Why? Casuals peak on weekends, members peak on weekday mornings & evenings.
Strategy:
Weekend Ads: Promote longer ride discounts to casual users.
Weekday Ads: Highlight convenience & cost savings for members.

Strategy: Offer optional guest profiles or loyalty points to track repeat casual users.
